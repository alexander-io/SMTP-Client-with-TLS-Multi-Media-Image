# The 'MIME-Version' field (with the value 1.0)
# and the 'Content-type' field. Read the documentation above to
# learn what value this should have for an email with text and

# part) from the second part of the mail (the image part)

# https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/4_Content-Type.html
# https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/5_Content-Transfer-Encoding.html

# For 'Content-type', you'll need to set the value so that the image
# is correctly interpreted as a JPEG image. This is also where you can
# set its name. Set the name to be "shark.jpg".
# for 'Content-Transfer-Encoding', you'll want to set it so that the
# image is read as Base64 encoding. Encoding the image in this way will
# ensure that it doesn't get corrupted.

# Be sure to send an extra carriage return/line feed at the end of the headers.
